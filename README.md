# trustmytag
Trustmytag is a foundation for establishing decentralized social credit and reducing risk in semi-anonymous transactions. It can replace simple integer based credit scores and provide an alternative to centralized and controlled social credit systems as found in China by allowing individuals and organizations to determine thir own trust parameters for engaging with others.
